#### Crash 2/3 export/import tool with the ability to change format of some entries to the other game's format (WIP)


##### How to run/compile
The code is in C++ but pretty much just C, as the file extension suggests, and should be compilable as it is with any regular C/C++ compiler.


##### How to use
See program's **help** command, if there are issues or questions DM me at Averso#5633.
